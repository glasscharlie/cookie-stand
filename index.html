    <p>We have developed a recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies. These cookies are made into the shape of a salmon, 
      and has just a hint of fishy goodness. Pat's cookies are prepared and baked in our kitchen, and every ingredient is measured precisely
       down to the gram to make the most delicious cookies. With many flavors to choose
        from, we are sure you can find something you'll love from our shop! </p>
